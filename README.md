# password-checker
A simple script to check if a password has been leaked.

This script asks the user to input a password and then checks it on the haveibeenpwned.com API to see if it has been leaked.

(NOTE: You should have the "requests", "hashlib" and "getpass" Python modules installed for this script to work.)

To run, save the file on your computer, open the folder where the script is on your terminal/cmd prompt, type "python checkpw.py" and press ENTER.
